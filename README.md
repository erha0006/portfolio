# portfolio
Reflection:
This is my portfolio about myself, Chloe Ann Erhardt. I am an 18 year old student learning web development, online domains, digital design, photography and more. Each individual subject has taught me so much on myself and how much I can learn with online information. This portfolio is based on my expierence with photography, which ended up being my overall favourite subject. My favourite part about photography is how much detail you effort you must put into getting the perfect photo. I personally prefer doing nature and hockey photography. This portfolio repersents me and what I like, some facts and a bit of contact information. 
Thank you.
